# AI Procurement Agent (Multi-Agent Pipeline)

This project demonstrates an automated multi-agent system for product sourcing using **CrewAI**.

The pipeline performs four main steps:
1. **Generate search queries** for a target product.
2. **Search e-commerce websites** using Tavily API.
3. **Scrape product details** (price, specs, images) using SmartScraper.
4. **Generate a procurement HTML report** comparing products.

The project shows my ability to:
- Build multi-agent workflows using CrewAI  
- Integrate external tools (search, scraping)  
- Structure outputs using Pydantic  
- Automate an end-to-end data pipeline  

This is one of my first practical projects in the field of AI agents.

Note: Running the notebook requires OpenAI / Tavily / ScrapeGraph API keys.  
The code is fully implemented but cannot be executed without valid API credits.
